# Yelp Review Prediction
This repository hosts the code for the CS 544 end of semester project. In order to ensure that we used only Restaurant data and that our data is in the format that we desire, we have added a script called data_extractor.py. It can be run as follows:

`python3 data_extractor.py '<location of folder containing yelp dataset>`

The above code should output a file called `dataset.csv` which will contain the data that we have used to train our model
